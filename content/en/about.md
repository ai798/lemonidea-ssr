I most often work with Laravel (and therefore PHP) for the back-end and front-end (for smaller projects). But for larger projects, I often use Vue.js/Nuxt.js in TypeScript for the front-end, with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. For SEO, I take care of the most important aspects to enable crawlers to promote the website in the best possible way, accompanying this with tracking services like Umami or Matomo. On the mobile side, beyond responsive web, I work with Flutter (Dart) to be able to deploy applications on Android and iOS, or create desktop-type applications.

I like to have knowledge of every part of the chain, from local development to deployment on a server (NGINX, PM2, Docker), which leads me to configure Linux servers quite often for both production and local development. I like to have efficient tools at my disposal, whatever the development environment (Linux, Windows or macOS), so that I can easily use this or that version of a language. That's why I also develop open-source libraries for PHP and Node.js, to avoid repeating certain things from one project to the next.

I develop best in groups, preferring communication to isolated development, provided I have colleagues who also appreciate this way of working. I like to discuss technologies, I'm interested in the latest versions of the languages I use and I spend a lot of time reading or making documentation, in Markdown of course. I always have too many projects on the go, but I always have something to do!

My favorite tools are :

- IDE : [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- System: macOS (M1 chip), Android
- Server: [Linux Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- Main technologies : [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- In addition : [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Ray](https://myray.app/), [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk)
