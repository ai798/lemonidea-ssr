  "text": "As a young developer, I started to develop my first real projects with **Laravel** (*PHP*), learning also to use **Git**. But I'm also very interested in the user experience, which pushes me to keep a link with the front-end with **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js** (*JavaScript* / *TypeScript*) with *CSS* frameworks like **Tailwind CSS**. I want to implement the necessary for **SEO**, although I am not an expert in this field. On the mobile side, beyond web responsive, I do **Flutter** (*Dart*) in order to be able to deploy applications on *Android* and on *iOS*.\n\nI like to have knowledge on each part of the chain, from local development to **deployment on a server** (with **NGINX**), which leads me to configure quite often **Linux** servers for both production and local development. Therefore, I like to have efficient tools, *whatever the development environment* (*Linux*, *Windows* or *macOS*) to be able to easily use such or such version of a language.\n\nI develop best in groups, preferring **communication** and **help** to isolated development, as long as I have colleagues who also enjoy this way of working. I love to *discuss technologies*, I'm interested in the *latest versions of the languages* I use and I spend a lot of time reading **documentation** or making it, in **Markdown** of course. I always have too many projects on the go, but I also always have something to do!",
